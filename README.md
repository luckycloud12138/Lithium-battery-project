# Lithium-battery-project
Our paper "SD-YOLO: A Lightweight Model for Small Target Defect Detection in Complex Environments of Lithium Batteries in New Energy Vehicles" is under review, and We decide to make the key code and dataset samples of our self-developed module, C3k2 GhostDynamicConv, publicly available in order to validate the authenticity of the experiments and the availability of the data.
